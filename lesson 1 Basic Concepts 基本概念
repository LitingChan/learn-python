1.1 What is Python?
     Python is a high-level program language, with applictions in numerous areas, including web programming, scripting, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence. 
     It is very popular and used by organizations such as Google, NASA, the CIA, and Disney.
     高级编程语言，包括：WEB编程，大数据，科学计算和人工智能。
1.2 Python 2.X与Python 3.X(略)
2.1 Your First Program
    The first program: "Hello world"
    >>>print("Hello world")
    Hello world
     
    The virable"print"
3.1 Simple Operations - add
      Python has the capability of carrying out calculations.
      Enter a calculation directly into the Python console, and it will output the anser.
      >>>2 + 2
      4
      >>>5 + 4 - 3
      6
      The spaces around the plus and minus signs here are optional (the code would work without them), but they make it easier to read.
3.2 Simple Operations - multiplication 
      Python also carries out multiplication and division, using an asterisk to indicate multiplication and a forward slash to indicate division. 
      use parentheses to determine which operations are performed first.
      >>>2 * (4 + 5)
      18
      >>>10 / 2
      5.0
      Using a single slash to divide numbers produces a decimal (or float, as it is called in programming). We'll have moreabout floats in a later lesson.
3.3 Simple Operations - negative number
      The minus sign indicates a negative number.
      Operations are performed on negative numbers, just as they are on positive ones.
      >>>-7
      -7
      >>>(-7 + 2) * (-4)
      20
      The plus signs can also be put in front of numbers, but this has no effect, and is mostly used to emphasize that a number is positive to increase readability of code.
3.4 Simple Operations - error
      Dividing by zro in Python produces an error, as no answer can be calculated.
      >>>11 / 0
      Traceback(most recent call last):
      file"<stdin>", line 1, in<module>
      ZeroDivisionError:division by zero
      In Python, the last linee of an error message indicates the error's type.
      Read error messages carefully, as they often tell you how to fix a program!
 3.5 Floats
      Floats are used in Python to represent number that aren't integers.
      Some examples of numbers that are represented as flots are 0.5 and -7.8237591.
      They can be created directly by entering a number's decimal point, or by using operations such as division on intergers. Extra zeros at the number's end are ignored.
      >>> 3/4
      0.75
      >>> 9.8765000
      9.8765
      Computers cant't store floats perfectly accuratey, in the same way tha we can't write down the complete decimal expansion of 1/3(0.333333333...). Keep this in mind, because it ofen leads to infuriating bugs!
