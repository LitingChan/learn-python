1.2 Python 2.X与Python 3.X(略)
2.1 Your First Program
    The first program: "Hello world"
    >>>print("Hello world")
    Hello world
     
    The virable"print"
3.1 Simple Operations
      Python has the capability of carrying out calculations.
      Enter a calculation directly into the Python console, and it will output the anser.
      >>>2 + 2
      4
      >>>5 + 4 - 3
      6
      The spaces around the plus and minus signs here are optional (the code would work without them), but they make it easier to read.
3.2 Simple Operations
      Python also carries out multiplication and division, using an asterisk to indicate multiplication and a forward slash to indicate division. 
      use parentheses to determine which operations are performed first.
      >>>2 * (4 + 5)
      18
      >>>10 / 2
      5.0
